AI supported AICTE Approval process portal

The AICTE is responsible for accrediting and approving technical education institutions in India, a process currently hampered by inefficiencies due to manual procedures and heavy paperwork. The proposed solution is an AI-supported portal designed to streamline and modernize the approval workflow. Key features include automating application submissions, enhancing document verification with AI, improving transparency through real-time tracking, optimizing resource allocation, and strengthening security measures. The expected benefits are faster processing times, reduced administrative burdens, greater accuracy in document validation, and improved communication between stakeholders. The portal aims to revolutionize the approval process, making it more efficient, transparent, and user-centric.
